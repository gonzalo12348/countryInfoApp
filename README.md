# ðŸŒŽ Country Info App

Country Info App is a full-stack application that provides detailed information about countries, including population statistics, flags, and general data. It uses a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend to deliver a seamless user experience.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Frontend: React, Axios

- Backend: Node.js, Express, dotenv

- APIs:
   - Nager.Date API for country data
   - CountriesNow API for population and flag data

## ðŸ“‚ Environment Variables Setup

To properly run this project, you need to configure environment variables for both the frontend and backend. Follow these steps to set them up:

#### 1. Create .env Files

You need two separate .env files:

- One for the frontend: client/.env.
- One for the backend: api/.env.
  These files will store sensitive information, such as API URLs and ports.

#### 2. Define Required Variables

- Frontend (client/.env):

Add the following variable to the .env file inside the client folder:

```bash
# Frontend Configuration
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

This variable defines the backend API URL that the frontend will use to make HTTP requests.

- Backend (api/.env):

Add the following variables to the .env file inside the api folder:

```bash
# Backend Configuration
PORT=5000
COUNTRY_API_URL=https://date.nager.at/api/v3
POPULATION_API_URL=https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/population
FLAG_API_URL=https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/flag/images
```

These variables specify:

The port on which the backend will run.
API URLs for country data, population data, and flags.

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the .env files are created, you need to install the project dependencies. This can be done with npm install in both the frontend (client) and backend (api) directories:

- Backend (api):

Go to the api folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

- Frontend (client):

Go to the client folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies in both parts of the project.

#### 4. Running the Project

After setting up the .env files and installing dependencies, you can run the project locally.

- Backend (API):

In the api directory, start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:5000.

- Frontend (Client):

In the client directory, start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000 (by default).

Once both servers are running, you should be able to access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## ðŸ“š Additional Information

The frontend communicates with the backend using the API URLs specified in the .env file.
Make sure both servers (frontend and backend) are running simultaneously to have a fully working app.
